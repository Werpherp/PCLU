Programmer/ Technical analysis

I enjoy driving, surfing, and boxing. A lot of my inspiration comes from those cool machines like F1 cars and fighter jets. Single.

1.2 Team Management
This project is the result of the hardwork of our team and a showcase of our spirit and drive to succeed in the competition and create a feat of robotics that we can be proud of that is worthy of a showcase at the largest robotics event in the phillipines. Each of our members worked hand in hand to be able to represent La union and we have learned more than we could've imagined by working on this project.

Team Supervisor: John Viray
Coaches: Bong John Abraham Agno/James


1.3 Reason to participate
We participate in this competition in order to showcase our skills and talents in order to succeed and cooperate as a great team. We must utilize our skills and cooperation in order to represent our province of La Union and be able to make our people proud and give them something to be proud about. We enjoy the challenge of being able to go against the biggest schools in the phillipines and creating robots that could one day make a difference.Most of all, we aim to win, but we also aim to have fun while doing so and enjoy what we do despite the hardcomning and all the negativities that come along our way on our path to victory

2.0 About the car

2.1 Our autonomous cars logic
The robot begins its by engaging its driving motors, allowing it to move forward

It then turns after a bit of time decided by a wait function

As a person would, it adjusts when it feels it's about to hit something, made possible by the multiple ultrasound sensors.

After 3 laps, it dies

it can differentiate colors through a mix of color sensors and a camera

The camera works as eyes and allows it to see better colors

if theres too much of a certain color and the distance is too close, it'll read the color and turn accordingly

(insert here how the fucking thing parks once we get a solution)

2.3 Why Ev3?
Despite our stubbornness to utilize Aisteam, Ev3 ultimately proved to be a much more reliable and faster option for us as its motor were much less jittery and much more durable. Additionally, the parts for Ev3 were much more accessible and allowed us to utilize it to a much higher potential than we ever could have with Aisteam, we work with what we have and we believe that we have enough to win the competition.
